# Brainflix API

This part of the project involves the development of a real API to replace the mock API, with specific requirements such as matching API endpoints and responses, implementing video upload functionality, and ensuring data persistence. Additionally, the project must adhere to visual design and implementation requirements, including responsiveness, alignment with mockups, and the incorporation of feedback. It's essential to follow proper folder structures and naming conventions, utilize provided assets, create multiple React components, implement routing, use SASS variables, apply BEM principles for CSS naming, and use Flexbox for layout control. This sprint aims to deliver a complete and polished product as requested by the client.
